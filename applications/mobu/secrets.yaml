app-alert-webhook:
  description: >-
    Slack web hook to which to post internal application alerts. This secret
    is not used directly by mobu, but is copied from here to all of the
    applications that report internal problems to Slack. It should normally be
    separate from mobu's own web hook, since the separate identities attached
    to the messages helps make the type of mesasge clearer, but the same web
    hook as mobu's own alerts can be used in a pinch.
  if: config.slackAlerts
ALERT_HOOK:
  description: >-
    Slack web hook to which mobu should report failures and daily status.
  if: config.slackAlerts
github-webhook-secret:
  description: >-
    Some mobu functionality can be triggered by requests from GitHub webhooks
    (like refreshing notebooks when changes are pushed to a repo). These
    webhooks get configured in the GitHub UI, and a "Secret" value must be
    provided in the UI. That value must match the value in this secret, or
    mobu will reject any requests coming from that webhook. By convention,
    This secret should be the the same for every mobu instance in every
    environment, and thus it should be the same in every mobu webhook
    configured in GitHub. If we need to change this value, it needs to be
    changed for every mobu instance and it needs to be changed in GitHub for
    every existing mobu webhook.
